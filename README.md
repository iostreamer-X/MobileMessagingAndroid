#MobileMessagingAndroid

My Object oriented software engineering lab required me to make a project
on mobile messaging system, so I did. This again is nothing special,
although it is complete in every sense. All you gotta do is, deploy the server
from [here](https://github.com/iostreamer-X/MobileMessagingServer) and
run this application(don't forget to change the ip).

The app lets you logins normally, with usual name and pass but uses your phone number as primary key.
Your contact list will be sent to the server, and it will respond with a list of contacts who use this app
and have registered. Click on their card and chat normally.

Here are some sweet screenshots:
